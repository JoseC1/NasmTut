#This is our make file here is where we put a script to run our file
#Purpose of a script is to not type the same repeating code over 
#and over again

#THIS IS WHERE U TELL UR MAKE COMMAND WHERE TO START OR SEQ TO FOLLOW 
all: asm3.o output

output: asm3.o
	gcc -m32 asm3.o -o output

#What we are saying is if our object file gets editted or created again
#then Re compile it and create a new exectuable file 

edit:
	vim asm3.asm

#This just runs our program

asm3.o: asm3.asm
	nasm -f elf32 asm3.asm -o asm3.o

#what this is saying is if our asm3.asm file gets editted 
#Then assemble it and make the executable linkable format 
#a 32 bit object

#Elf stand for executable and linkable format 
#elf32 tells our assembler its a 32 file 
 
run:
	-@ ./output

clean:
	rm *.o output


#GOING TO PUTSOME MACROS ACCESS THEM By typing $(Macroname)

RUN=./output


#this cleans us of all object files and of our exectuable file
